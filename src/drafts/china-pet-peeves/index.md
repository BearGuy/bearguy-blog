# Outline
There are many things to enjoy about living in Beijing. As October sets in we're just staritng to leave the period of perfect weather just before winter sets in. The air remains crisp and (occasionally) clear as you enjoy strolling around Sanlitun, taking in what life has to offer on a warm Sunday afternoon. You are given the ability to eat trememdous food at a reasonable price from a variety of different places. If you choose to indulge in it, there's a tremendous amount of good food to eat while you're here as well.

However, be aware of the costs of eating at these establishments. I'm not just talking about the monetary costs, but there lies a more dormant cost that afflicts only a certain group of people. Unfortunately, I've tend to find myself in that group of people. I've understood this about myself for a long time, this is not a recent discovery in the slightest. For years, I shot dirty looks across the dinner table for those who would violate my ears with their loud chewing. Hell, even if they weren't chewing with their mouth open, if they chewed in the wrong way I'd chew them out. My poor brother took the brunt of these looks growing up (sorry Ben), and as I grew older I had hoped that I would grow out of this. Those with the greatest hope were my parents, specifically my father. He had the greatest hope that this too would pass, and at some point we'd be able to have meals in peace without me becoming a terrible to the rest of the family. 

Unfortunately for him, this wasn't because I had a grudge against people chewing food. In 2014, the condition known as [misophonia](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia) was acknowledged among medical professionals.
