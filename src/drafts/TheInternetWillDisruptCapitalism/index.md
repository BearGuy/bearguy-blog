## Outline:
Thesis: The internet has spawned a decentralized future that is currently motion, and will disrupt capitalism in the same way capitalism disrupted feudalism. It is in the economic interest of the reader to imagine how this future will manifest itself and to participate in building the future.

- Feudalism vs Capitalism -- what changed and why
- Modern day Corporate Capitalism -- The benefits and flaws of the sharing economy
- The Future -- my prediction and why should you care

## How Capitalism Conquered Feudalism

In the middle ages, the peasant class were forced to live off of the land of the lords and ladies in order to survive. This was necessary for a couple of reasons, the biggest one being that the Lord's provided protection from thugs and bandits that would come to harm them as they exercised political and juridical as well as economic power in the their region.

- Incredibly rural society, land was the basis of making money
- Because of this, the need for land produced many armed conflicts between the ruling class (comparisons to the US MID with capitalism)
- The collapse was partially driven by this, but also serf revolution and overall the inefficiencies of the system
- The rise of the merchant class (OG entrepreneurs), before hand there were peddlers that were hated by communities (aka drifters) who would go town to town selling salt
- The Peasant Revolt sparked wealth redistribution and delivered wealth into the hands on entrepreneurs
- Increased trade and communications helped further accelerate the devolution of feudalism and introduce capitalism

"Karl Marx points out the fall of feudalism should be mainly attributed to internal factors. As demand for commodities grew as a result of new markets and increase in trade, the inefficiency of the rigid feudal structure of production failed to meet new demand. New methods of production arose, thereby increasing division of labor which enhanced productivity. As capitalist modes of production improved, landlords began to perceive themselves as businessmen, thus striving for higher economic returns. As technology improved, new modes of production were only probable if farming was on larger fields. Fiefs were kicked off the land, those who left moved on to join towns and cities while the rest remained to become paid laborers."

>*_The inefficiencies of the rigid feudal structure of production failed to meet new demand. New methods of production arose, thereby increasing division

This came at a severe cost and exploitation of the serfs, where the aristocrats were able to survive of their labor (sound familiar??). Eventually, this structure wasn't able to survive for a couple of reasons. The biggest one is that the commodity of labor increase significantly after a couple of disasters (The Black plague being the greatest one).
- Discuss duke that stayed on his land and went broke, in comparison to the dukes that embraced capitalism and continued to aggregate capital at an astounding rate
- "Even where wealthy merchants remained in trade they soon put the stress on establishing ties with the old ruling class in order to establish monopoly control over their line of business, rather than on revolutionary subversion of that class."


## Modern Corporatism and The Digital Feudal Lords
- Capitalism has generally increased the quality of life immenesly since the Industrial Revolution (link to 3rd world nations quality of life still increasing)
- Many people rely on companies and corporations for their source of income, and that has been successful for decades
- However, just like the feaudal system, people are being left behind with the rise of automation and decreased commoditization of global labor markets
- The exact opposite of what happened to feudalism has arisen with an abundance of cheap labor globally
- Specific laws have given corporations immense power, and centralized crony capitalism has made a career of confusing people and having them vote against their own interests (link to ISP's fighting against municipal internet)
- Note problems with increased national power with the rise of Donald Trump and muslim ban. Everyone loved when Obama made gay marriage legal across the country, and everyone saw how dangerous that power is in the wrong hands with Trump
- People like Gary V are showing that there are new ways to make money outside of these traditional ways that are failing Millenials/GenZ
- This comes at the cost of building content/projects in the land of the new Feudal Lords (Google, Facebook, Amazon)
- One only has to observe the Youtube Ad-pocalypse to see how shaky the ground is for anyone who is building content on these platforms
- Personally, a project of mine went up in smoke as it heavily relied on Facebook's API right around the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal broke. We were instantly denied access as we were an app still in development and months of work was thrown out the window.
- The dominance of a handful of centralized companies has created neo-feudal digital realm, the new serfs are at completely at the mercy of the digital wars amongst these companies

>*_The dominance of a handful of centralized companies has created neo-feudal digital realm, the new serfs are at completely at the mercy of the "land" wars amongst these companies are involved in_*


- Not to mention how many companies are completely reliant on AWS
- We're taking the right steps (people starting their own businesses, using the internet to make money), however, we're building on very shaky, very feudalistic ground

## Post-Capitalism and The Future of Decentralization
- Also in the past decades, open-source projects have completely revolutionized
- Linux
- Wikipedia
- THE INTERNET HELLO
- https://nycmesh.net/blog/public-access-points/

- Also in the last decade, we've seen the rise of crypto currencies (with a couple actually surviving outside of bitcoin)
- With blockchain technology, we've shown that we can change the economic incentives of our systems to achieve decentralized systems that are untamperable (at scale at least)

- Increased networking capabilities (similar to those which helped instill capitalism) has brought about an unparallaled framework for communicating

- The idea of tokenization is that open source projects will be able to efficiently reward contributed value in a flexible way that corporations won't be able to match
- Ideally bounties will be given out in a way that people can make money ASAP by contributing to a project (producing content, writing code, marketing the product from their social media accounts)
- For the time being, it's up to the more financially secure members of a project to be able to support those who are contributing value but aren't able to financially support themselves
